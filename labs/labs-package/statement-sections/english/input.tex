The first line contains a single integer $q$, the number of queries.

This is followed by $q$ lines, each describing a query. Each query is in one of the forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item $1\ s\ i$

\item $2\ j$
\end{itemize}

as described above. $s$ is a string of lowercase English letters representing the trainer's name. $i$ and $j$ are integers representing lab indices.
