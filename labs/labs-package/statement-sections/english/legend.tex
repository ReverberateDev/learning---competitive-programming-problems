The trainers at December Course 2024 are overwhelmed by the number of signups this year. With only a small number of trainers available, it's common to see trainers moving between labs. TheRaptor wants to monitor each trainer's movements to ensure no one is slacking off.

All trainers start off not being in any labs. Trainers can move to a new lab $i$, and TheRaptor wants to know how many trainers are currently in lab $j$. Your task is to help TheRaptor answer these queries efficiently.

You will be given $q$ queries, which can be one of two types:

\begin{itemize}
\item $1\ s\ i$: Trainer $s$ leaves the lab they are currently in (if any) and moves to lab $i$. Trainer $s$ may move back to the same lab or to a different one (To go to the toilet lol).

\item $2\ j$: Output the number of trainers currently in lab $j$.
\end{itemize}
