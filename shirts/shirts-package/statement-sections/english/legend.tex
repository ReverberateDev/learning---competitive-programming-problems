The trainers of December Course 2024 are arranging participants into $N$ groups, numbered $1$ to $N$, placed in a row. For simplicity, each participant in group $i$ initially wears a shirt of color $i$.

The trainers can issue commands to modify group shirt colors or check specific color statistics. They provide $Q$ commands in total, which must be processed in the given order. Commands are of the following two types:

\begin{itemize}
\item $1\ x\ c$: Change the shirt color of trainee $x$ and all connected trainees (trainees reachable by moving through adjacent groups with the same shirt color) to color $c$.

\item $2\ c$: Report how many trainees are currently wearing shirts of color $c$.
\end{itemize}
